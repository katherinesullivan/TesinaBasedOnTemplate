abstract = {This dissertation presents methods for the formal modeling and specification of probabilistic systems, and algorithms for the automated verification of these systems. Our system models describe the behavior of a system in terms of probability, nondeterminism, fairness and time. The formal specification languages we consider are based on extensions of branching-time temporal logics, and enable the expression of single-event and long-run average system properties. This latter class of properties, not expressible with previous formal languages, includes most of the performance properties studied in the field of performance evaluation, such as system throughput and average response time. Our choice of system models and specification languages has been guided by the goal of providing efficient verification algorithms. The algorithms rely on the theory of Markov decision processes, and exploit a connection between the graph-theoretical and probabilistic properties of these processes. This connection also leads to new results about classical problems, such as an extension to the solvable cases of the stochastic shortest path problem, an improved algorithm for the computation of reachability probabilities, and new results on the average reward problem for semi-Markov decision processes.}

abstract="The theory of graph games with $\omega$-regular winning conditions is the foundation for modeling and synthesizing reactive processes. In the case of stochastic reactive processes, the corresponding stochastic graph games have three players, two of them (System and Environment) behaving adversarially, and the third (Uncertainty) behaving probabilistically. We consider two problems for stochastic graph games: the qualitative problem asks for the set of states from which a player can win with probability 1 (almost-sure winning); the quantitative problem asks for the maximal probability of winning (optimal winning) from each state. We show that for Rabin winning conditions, both problems are in NP. As these problems were known to be NP-hard, it follows that they are NP-complete for Rabin conditions, and dually, coNP-complete for Streett conditions. The proof proceeds by showing that pure memoryless strategies suffice for qualitatively and quantitatively winning stochastic graph games with Rabin conditions. This insight is of interest in its own right, as it implies that controllers for Rabin objectives have simple implementations. We also prove that for every $\omega$-regular condition, optimal winning strategies are no more complex than almost-sure winning strategies.",

abstract="We address the problem of verifying Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) properties of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) whose state transition probabilities are only known to lie within uncertainty sets. We first introduce the model of Convex-MDPs (CMDPs), i.e., MDPs with convex uncertainty sets. CMDPs generalize Interval-MDPs (IMDPs) by allowing also more expressive (convex) descriptions of uncertainty. Using results on strong duality for convex programs, we then present a PCTL verification algorithm for CMDPs, and prove that it runs in time polynomial in the size of a CMDP for a rich subclass of convex uncertainty models. This result allows us to lower the previously known algorithmic complexity upper bound for IMDPs from co-NP to PTIME. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach by verifying a consensus protocol and a dynamic configuration protocol for IPv4 addresses.",
